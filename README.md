# Travel Masti Support Bot:

# Azure services used in this project

1)azure power virtual agent 2)Azure static webapp

I employed an AI-powered virtual agent to create question and answer pairs. I added a virtual agent with AI power to the static. I then used Static Web App Service for hosting. A service called Azure Static Web Apps uses a code repository to automatically generate and deploy full stack web apps to Azure.

# Azure Static Web Apps: 

Following are some key features of Azure Static Web Apps that made me choose this service:

1. Web hosting for images, JavaScript, CSS, and other static material.

2. Azure Functions offers integrated API support with the possibility to connect an already-existing Azure Functions app with a normal account.

3. Outstanding GitHub and Azure DevOps integration, in which builds and deploys are triggered by changes to the repository.

4. Static material that is delivered globally, bringing it closer to your users.

5. Free SSL certificates that renew themselves automatically.

6. Unique domains to give your app branded modifications.
